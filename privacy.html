  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: <span id="d"></span></p>

  <p>Flight Copilot (“the App”) is published by Electric Dream Software (“we”, “us”). We design the App to work fully offline and to process sensor data on your device.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No account.</strong> We do not create or require user accounts.</li>
    <li><strong>No ads. No analytics.</strong> We do not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.</li>
    <li><strong>On-device processing.</strong> Motion and pressure sensor readings are processed on your device and are not transmitted to us.</li>
    <li><strong>Optional crash reports.</strong> If you opt to share diagnostics with Apple, we may receive anonymised crash logs via Apple.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data we process</h2>
  <p><strong>On-device only:</strong> The App reads device sensors (e.g., accelerometer/gyroscope for turbulence &amp; horizon; barometer for cabin pressure/cabin altitude; location for nearest-airport detection). These readings are used in real time and may be stored locally in your flight log on the device. We do not receive this data.</p>

  <h3>Location</h3>
  <p>The App may request permission to access location to set origin/destination airports automatically. Location is used on-device and is not sent to any server. You can disable location in iOS Settings.</p>

  <h3>Crash diagnostics (optional)</h3>
  <p>If you enable “Share with App Developers” in iOS, Apple may share anonymised crash reports and basic device information with us (e.g., iOS version, device model). We use these solely to fix stability issues. We cannot identify you from these reports.</p>

  <h2>What we do not collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No names, emails, or contact details inside the App</li>
    <li>No precise location history stored or transmitted to us</li>
    <li>No advertising identifiers, tracking, or profiling</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data storage &amp; retention</h2>
  <p>Your flight logs and settings are stored locally on your device and remain until you delete them or uninstall the App. We do not operate a backend service for this data.</p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us information via external contact (e.g., email), contact us and we will delete it.</p>

  <h2>Your rights</h2>
  <p>Under UK GDPR/GDPR and similar laws, you may have rights to access or delete personal data we hold. As we do not hold user-identifying data for normal App use, these rights typically do not apply. For crash reports received via Apple, requests should be directed to Apple.</p>

  <h2>International transfers</h2>
  <p>We do not transfer your App data to our servers. Crash logs, if any, are processed by Apple under their terms.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy for new features (e.g., analytics, cloud backup). We will update the date above and reflect changes in App release notes.</p>
